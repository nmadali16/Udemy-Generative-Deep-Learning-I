# Udemy-Generative-Deep-Learning-I

Welcome to the Deep Image Generative Models Course

Unlock the power of deep learning to create and manipulate images like never before. This course is designed for enthusiasts and professionals eager to dive into the world of image generation using advanced deep learning techniques. 

What You Will Learn:

Image Encoding and Decoding: Understand the fundamentals of how images are encoded into numerical representations and decoded back to visual formats.

Latent Space: Explore the concept of latent space and its significance in image generation and manipulation.

Image Editing in Latent Space: Learn how to edit images by manipulating their latent representations, enabling sophisticated transformations and enhancements.

Autoencoder: Delve into autoencoders, understanding their architecture and applications in unsupervised learning.

Variational Autoencoder (VAE): Gain insights into VAEs, learning how they generate new images by sampling from a latent space.

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs):  Master the basics of GANs, including their unique training dynamics involving a generator and a discriminator.

Wasserstein GAN (WGAN): Explore WGANs and understand how they improve upon traditional GANs by stabilizing training and enhancing image quality.
